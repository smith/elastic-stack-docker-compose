# Elastic Stack Docker Compose

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration to run the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/) components.

This is meant to be a development and demo environment to solve these problems:

- Work on development of OpenTelemetry-related features in Elastic Observability
- Run pre-release builds of components to preview upcoming features
- Get an Elastic environment that can collect OpenTelemetry data up and running quickly

Runs:

- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch)
- [The Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry)
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana)

### Requirements

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Usage

- Clone this repository
- `cd elastic-stack-docker-compose`
- `docker compose up`
- Open https://localhost:5601
- Log in with `elastic`/`changeme`
- Adjust configuration in the files in this repository for your needs
- If you have improvements or fixes, open a pull request to https://github.com/smith/elastic-stack-docker-compose

#### OpenTelemetry Demo

To send data from the [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/demo/) to this cluster, check out a copy of the demo and run `env OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST=host.docker.internal docker compose up -d` to start the demo. It will send all data from the demo to our collector instead of the collector included in the demo.

#### Elastic Universal Profiling

Universal Profiling services are not started by default. Use the [profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/profiles/#start-specific-profiles) to start them:

```
docker compose --profile profiling up
```

#### Kibana TLS

Kibana is configured for HTTP2 by default. The HTTPS connection will not be trusted unless you configure your operating system to trust the certificate.

To get a copy out of the certificate from a running environment run:

```bash
docker compose run setup_certs cat config/certs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.crt > cert
```

On MacOS you can add this certificate to the trusted store with:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustAsRoot -p ssl -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain cert
```

You'll need to do this again if the volume for the certificates gets recreated.

#### Docker Compose metrics

To collect [Docker Compose metrics](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/otel/), set the environment variable `DOCKER_CLI_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317`. These metrics go to the `metrics-generic-default` data stream with `service.name=docker` and `service.name=docker-compose`.

#### Selecting which services to run

If you don't need a particular service (let's say you already have Kibana running in dev mode), you can add `scale: 0` to the service definition to prevent it from being started when `docker compose up` is run. You can also run `docker compose stop SERVICE_NAME` to stop an individual service.

#### Elastic APM Server

[Elastic APM Server](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm-getting-started-apm-server.html#apm-setup-apm-server-binary) is included for testing with legacy scenarios.

To start the APM server run:

```
docker compose --profile apm up
```

To configure the OpenTelemetry collector to send data to the APM Server, uncomment the `traces/fromsdk` pipeline under the `# Send traces to APM server` comment.

#### Updating image

In [.env](./env) the default image variables look like this:

```
KIBANA_IMAGE=docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

When you first start, it will download the latest snapshot image. to update to the latest image, for, for example, Kibana, run:

```bash
docker compose stop kibana
docker compose rm -f kibana
docker compose pull kibana
```

You can omit `kibana` to update all images.

## Data collected

- Any OpenTelemetry log or metric data sent to localhost:4317-4318 (use `host.docker.internal` from containers.)
- [HTTP checks](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/README.md) for Elasticsearch and Kibana. These metrics go to the `metrics-generic-default` data stream with `http` and `httpcheck` fields.
- [Host metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver). These are processed with the [Elastic Infra Metrics Processor](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-collector-components/blob/main/processor/elasticinframetricsprocessor/README.md)
- [OpenTelemetry collector internal logs and metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/internal-telemetry/)
- Logs from Elasticsearch and Kibana

## Upstream docker-compose.yml configurations

This compose.yaml is based on these sources:

- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/8b09e9119d17dcf82a67aaefdcd5ce224a5c8598/docs/reference/setup/install/docker/docker-compose.yml)
- [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

## Why doesn't this use Kubernetes?

If you need Kubernetes, you should use it. See the [Elastic Kubernetes documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-deploy-elasticsearch.html). This is a simpler environment meant to run on a single computer.
